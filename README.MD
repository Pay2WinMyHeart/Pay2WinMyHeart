- Hi. I'm generally quiet on Pony Town. If none of my friends are online, I'm likely AFK.

-I'm always comfortable with C + H from anyone if I'm alone. But I'm likely afk. 

- I like to roleplay on Islands.

- Currently recovering, so please be patient with me. I get stressed out by situations easily and tend to randomly leave because of it.

- I like Cookie Run a lot.

- If you think you've seen me before, you have. I had to delete so many internet accounts after a few incidents in the past.
